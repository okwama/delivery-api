We will particularly focus on the <strong>most expensive wines in Kenya</strong> and the reason as to why their prices is higher than the other wines.</p><p>Before we dive into our topic, it will be great to mention all the <a href=\"/wine\" target=\"_blank\">wine brands in Kenya</a>. We have a wide collection of wines since we shop wine online from all corners of the globe to ensure we have the best wines in Kenya. The following are among the popular wines in Kenya.</p><p><br></p><h2>Types Of Wines In Kenya</h2><ol><li>sweet red wines</li><li>sweet white wines</li><li>dry red wines</li><li>dry white wines</li><li>rose wines</li><li>sparkling wines</li><li>port wines</li><li><a href=\"/champagne\" target=\"_blank\">champagnes</a></li><li>fortified wines</li><li>vermouth wines</li></ol><p><br></p><p>You can order wine online to enjoy reliable <a href=\"/wine\" target=\"_blank\">wine delivery</a> services.

This price range is justified by several factors as follows;</p><p>Factors Affecting Price of Wine</p><ul><li>Grapes used in production</li><li>The method used in production</li><li>Time used in production</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Wine Grapes</h2><p>There are so many wine grapes in the world but only a few of them are used to make wine. The taste of wine is influenced by the grapes from which it is produced. Same grape might have different taste depending on where its grown due to climatic factors and soil conditions. Climatic conditions also hinder some grapes from growing in particular regions completely. Dark grapes are used to make red wines while the white grapes are used to make<a href=\"/wine/white-wine\" target=\"_blank\"> white wines</a>. Rose wine is made from dark grapes, however, the grapes must have their skin removed after crushing them. This is why rose wines are pink in color and also share a lot of similarities with <a href=\"/wine/red-wine\" target=\"_blank\">red wines</a>. White wines can also be made from red grapes but the grapes must have their skin peeled before crushing and fermentation. Sometimes wines are made from blending different grapes. This is done to improve the quality and the taste of the wines. Good examples of blended wines are Cellar Cask, Four Cousins, 4th Street, Altar wine, Robertson Winery and Saint Celine. The following are the most popular wine grapes that are used to make wines. These grapes are used to make either red wines or white wines.</p><p><br></p><h2>Popular Wine Grapes Varietals</h2><ol><li><strong>Cabernet Sauvignon</strong></li><li><strong>Sauvignon Blanc</strong></li><li><strong>Chenin Blanc ( Stein )</strong></li><li><strong>Chardonnay</strong></li><li><strong>Merlot</strong></li><li><strong>Malbec</strong></li><li><strong>Shiraz / Syrah</strong></li><li><strong>Pinotage</strong></li><li><strong>Zinfandel</strong></li><li><strong>Baronne ( Cabernet Sauvignon Shiraz )</strong></li><li><strong>Pinot Noir</strong></li><li><strong>&nbsp;Pinot Grigio</strong></li><li><strong>Pinot Gris</strong></li><li><strong>Riesling</strong></li><li><strong>Moscato</strong></li></ol><p><br></p><p>Wines are classified as blends or varietals. Blends are those wines that are made from several inferior grapes while varietals are those wines that are made from one or two superior grapes and have those grapes indicated on the bottle. Some grapes can only grow in particular regions while others are expensive to grow. Wines made from inferior grapes are cheap while wines made from superior and rare grapes are quite expensive. Let’s take the case of <a href=\"/wine/sparkling-wine\" target=\"_blank\">sparkling wines</a> and champagne. Champagnes are made from three superior grapes; Chardonnay, Pinot Meunier, and Pinot Noir. On the other hand, sparkling wines are made from even blends of inferior grapes. This makes champagne more expensive in comparison with other sparkling wines. A good example of sparkling wine that is made from a blend of grapes is Four Cousin Sparkling wine. However, there are still other sparkling wines that follow all the rules of champagne production so they are expensive than other sparkling wines but a bit cheaper in comparison with champagne. A good example of such a sparkling wine is Prosecco. This is a sparkling made in Italy.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2>Wine Production Method</h2><p>Red wines, <a href=\"/wine/white-wine\" target=\"_blank\">white wines</a>, and<a href=\"/wine/rose-wine\" target=\"_blank\"> rose wines</a> are produced through the same method. However, when it comes to fortified wines like vermouth and <a href=\"/wine/port-wine\" target=\"_blank\">port wines</a> the method is different because there is adding of clear brandy increase the alcohol concentration and flavoring with herbs to improve the taste. The most complex ones are sparkling wines and champagnes. When it comes to this two option, they undergo two fermentation processes to add carbon dioxide that makes them fizzy and pop up during celebrations when they are shaken. The following are the three methods used to make sparkling wines and champagnes;</p><p>The traditional method (Methode Champenoise)</p><p>Bulk Chamat</p><p>Bottle Transfer Method</p><p>The traditional method is the most complex one among the three methods. It is too technical and time taking. The technicality of every wine production method is what brings the price variance.</p><p><br></p><h2>Time Used in Production</h2><p>Different wine production method have different time span. Also, different wines are produced for a different amount of time. For example, vintage champagnes are aged for a minimum of three years while non-vintage champagnes are aged for 15 months. The same case applies to the port wines where some of them are not aged while others are aged. The aged port wines are called tawny port. During aging, evaporation takes place leaving behind a concentrated wine which means the quality increases but also the volume of the wine reduces. Due to the reduction in volume, it makes every milliliter of the wine cost more than the non-aged wines.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In conclusion, the champagne is the <strong>most expensive wines in Kenya</strong> followed by<strong> Port wines</strong>. This is because they use superior grapes, complex production method and also they are aged for some time.

        "body" : "<p>Alcohol has become a basic need to many people living in Nairobi and Mombasa city. There is no party or event that will ever be termed as complete if the guest have not sipped some good wine or a great spirit. Even in our homes, a meal without a glass of wine is never complete. Actually, there is a saying that goes like this, “A meal without a glass of wine is called breakfast”. Now that we all love to enjoy our alcohol, the real question is how we get our drinks. Some people choose to go to clubs and others will choose to buy from <a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>wines and spirits shops</strong></a>. There are still some other people who are clever enough to <a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>buy alcohol online</strong></a><strong> </strong>from <strong>online liquor stores </strong>and have it delivered right to their houses or office. With <strong>online shopping </strong>being the new trend in the city, <strong>ordering alcohol online </strong>is the best option of the three.

There are so many factors you need to consider when you want to go to a club. Most of the good clubs are located a long distance from us where you need to drive, take a cab, board a bus or a “boda-boda”. Let’s take a deeper look why going to a club is not advisable unless you are with your mates and the occasion really needs a club.</p><h2>Disadvantages Of Clubbing Vs Online Alcohol Delivery Services</h2><ul><li>They sell drinks at exaggerated prices in comparison with <strong>online alcohol shops</strong></li><li>The extra cost of taking a cab or driving your vehicle to the club and back</li><li>The risk of being mugged by the cab guys or thugs around the club</li><li>Discomfort from the loud and noisy music in clubs. It is even worse when two clubs are adjacent to each other.</li><li>Poor music system and poor selection of music from the DJ makes the whole clubbing thing boring</li><li>Some clubs are so explicit with waitress being more than half naked</li><li>There is no privacy between you and your lover while drinking in a club</li><li>Risk of being overcharged when you get drunk</li><li>Risk of unprotected sex when you are drunk which can lead to unwanted pregnancy and STDs</li><li>Risk of road accidents should you drive when drunk</li><li>Risk of huge fines from NTSA should you be found driving while drunk</li><li>Your vehicle could be stolen when you are drinking due to lack of security around the club</li><li>The risk of your drinks being drugged for you to get robbed</li></ul><p>AS we have clearly shown, buying alcohol from local wines and spirits or clubbing are not appealing options.

        "body" : "<p>Did you know what you drink defines who you are? Ladies are known to drink <a href=\"/wine\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>wine</strong></a>, guys are known to drink <a href=\"/beer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>beer</strong></a> but real gentlemen drink <a href=\"/whisky\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>whiskey</strong></a>. Whisky is a dark spirit made from ageing a distillation of fermented grain mash. The ageing must be done in wooden casks which are sometimes charred. There are different <a href=\"/whisky\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>categories of whisky</strong></a><strong> </strong>depending on production method, country of production, style of whisky, how long the whisky is aged, grains used to produce the whisky and also whether the whiskey is flavoured or not. These six factors are the ones that influences <strong>whiskey prices in Kenya.</strong> In this article, we will talk about the seven tips on how to enjoy whisky like a gentleman. These tips will distinguish you from whisky amateurs and make you a whisky aficionado.</p><h2>1. Pick your whisky wisely</h2><p>The following are the main categories of whisky and within this categories, there are different brands. Different types of whisky have different taste so you might have to try all of them before you choose to settle down with one type of whisky. You might not love whisky for the first time due to its strong taste and smell but be sure if you try it three times in a row you will be a big fan of it. If you are a beer drinker it is the time you should graduate to whisky. Beers will give you a pot belly but whisky will restore your flat stomach. Some whisky brands have a superior taste, some are of high quality and some have the best flavours. The good thing is that <a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Drinks Delivery Kenya</strong></a>, an online <a href=\"/whisky\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>whisky shop in Nairobi CBD</strong></a>, stocks all types of <a href=\"/whisky\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>whisky brands in Kenya</strong></a>. The following are the major <a href=\"/whisky\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>types of whisky in Kenya</strong></a><strong> </strong>that you might choose to explore to find your favourite one.</p><p><strong>Types Of Whiskey In Kenya</strong></p><ul><li>Single Malt whisky</li><li>Blended Scotch whisky</li><li>Irish Whiskey</li><li>Tennessee &amp; Bourbon Whiskey (American whiskey)</li><li>Japanese Whisky</li><li>Indian Whisky</li><li>Canadian Whisky</li></ul><h2>2. Know How To Drink Your Whisky</h2><p>There are several ways you can enjoy your glass of whisky. However, you must have the recommended whisky glasses for you to enjoy the thrilling experience of drinking whisky. Different whisky brands have their recommended whisky glasses though there are general whisky glasses which are accepted for drinking whisky. Some whisky distilleries have gone a further step and branded their own glasses to ensure you feel a full attachment to their whisky brand. There is one golden rule while drinking whisky; don’t fill the glass. By ensuring the glass of whisky is at most half full gives whisky a room to breathe giving you a chance to inhale the flavours as you sip your whisky.</p><p>Let’s now focus on the main business of ensuring we enjoy maximum flavours of whisky when it goes down our thirst throat. The four ways you could enjoy whisky are as follows;</p><ul><li><strong>Drink the whisky neat –</strong> this is where you drink the whisky the way it is. You just pour it in the glass and sip it. This is mostly known with whiskey aficionados because they love the strong taste and smell of whisky.</li><li><strong>Drink the whisky on the rocks –</strong> this is another way to expose the flavours of the whisky. The ice cubes chill the whisky and dilute it slightly cutting out that burning effect. First, put the ice cubes on the glass then add the whisky on top. </li><li><strong>Drink whisky with water</strong> – you can expose some great flavours of whisky by adding some spring water or any still water to a glass with some whisky. Remember you only need to dilute the whisky a little bit, therefore, only add some little water. The water that will be added to the whisky needs to be at the same temperatures as the whisky because cold water might kill some good flavours of the whisky. </li><li><strong>Drink whisky with chasers –</strong> besides water, there are other chasers that are great while drinking whisky. Some of the common chasers that are used with whiskey are <strong>tonic water</strong>, <strong>soda water, sodas, lime juice, fruit juices </strong>and <strong>beers</strong>.</li></ul><h2>3. Check The Age Of Whisky</h2><p>This is one of the most important things for any whisky enthusiast. The older the whisky, the better the quality. However, there is a misconception around the colour of the whisky making us believe that the darker the whisky the better the quality. It is this misconception that has driven some whisky distilleries to add caramel on their whisky brands to make them look darker and appealing. In the real sense, the colour of the whisky is only supposed to tell us the wood barrel used to age the whisky because whisky takes the colour barrel in which it is aged. Some whisky like <a href=\"https://www.nairobidrinks.co.ke/brand/macallan\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Macallan</strong></a> is not flavoured with caramel hence they look more clear yet they are full of flavours. Single malt whiskies and most of the blended whiskies have the number of the years they are aged indicated on the bottle. The reason for aged whiskies to have higher quality is due to evaporation of water while ageing in the barrels and also gaining more flavours from the wood during ageing. Some distilleries age their whisky in three different barrels to ensure the whisky has better flavours. To be realistic, you don’t expect great whisky that cost cheap. High-quality whiskies are expensive, smooth and have awesome flavours.</p><h2>4. Take Whisky Any Time</h2><p>Whisky is not for special times like birthdays, graduations and those other events that are memorable. Let those events be kept aside for popping a bottle of <a href=\"/champagne\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>champagne</strong></a> or a high-quality <a href=\"/wine/sparkling-wine\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>sparkling wine</strong></a>. Any time is whisky drinking time...you might even take a sip of a high-quality whisky after breakfast before you step out for a long day. The great thing about whisky is that it gives someone the confidence of facing anything and also gives a relaxing effect when sipped in the evening after a long busy day. Find out that particular awesome whisky that will give awesome feeling any time you sip it. You could choose to enjoy <strong>single malt whisky </strong>or <strong>blended whisky</strong>. For single malt whisky, they are strong in smell and every distillery have a particular taste that is used as the trademark for that distillery. On the other hand, blended whiskies are a bit chilled and are mild in taste though they have more flavours gained from blending grain whisky and single malt whiskies. However, single malt whiskies are generally expensive than the blended whiskies though there are specially blended whiskies that are really expensive like <a href=\"https://www.nairobidrinks.co.ke/product/johnnie-walker-odyssey\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Johnnie Walker Odyssey @ Ksh 150,000</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a href=\"https://www.nairobidrinks.co.ke/product/johnnie-walker-blue-label-king-george-v\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Johnnie Walker King George V @ Ksh 75,000</strong></a>.</p><h2>5. Buy Whisky Online In Kenya</h2><p>In comparison with local <a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>wines and spirits in Kenya</strong></a>, <a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>online liquor stores</strong></a> and particularly <a href=\"/whisky\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>whisky shops</strong></a> are your best bet when it comes to buying whisky.
